contain more of the query terms score higher. By using OR query, we can get much more relevent documents return. So we can increase map score by doing so. Because the factory number only between 0 and 1, it is easilier by using the trial and error method to find the best factory number, i found that the factory=0.8 can provide the best result.\n","\n","*   Also, I used whoosh scoring BM25F function, I have tried different B,K combinations and find out B = 0.5, k=5, can result map 0.4107. Since B and K combinations can be varied so differently, it is hard to find the best B and K values that can provided best performance.
