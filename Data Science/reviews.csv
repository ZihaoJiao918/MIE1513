The refrigerator was quite cold.  Had plenty of lights and electric outlets. The shower was nice, with a nice adjustable shower head, but it had that single handle faucet I dislike without separate temperature and flow controls, and the shower squealed when it ran, which had to be very annoying to anyone in nearby rooms.

Nice hotel, room was updated with newer carpet and a 40 inch flat screen tv with all HD channel lineup. Beds were comfortable and room overall was clean. Upon check in, the desk clerk said they had me in one of the \""motel\"" rooms but asked if I wanted to be moved inside, and I said sure. I am glad I did! This hotel is set up as a 3 (or maybe 4) buildings complex. One of which is the main building with front desk, breakfast room, pool, and 2 stories of normal hotel rooms that have been recently renovated\u002Fupdated. The 2-3 other buildings surrounding the main building were two story \""old school\"" motel type rooms, and they did look quite uninviting and ran down. Upon check out, I told the clerk that my room was nice and asked if it was recently remodeled and she said yes. I asked about the \""motel\u002Fexterior entry\"" rooms and she said \""they are working on it\"".  My guess is the main building might have been built years after the motel units. So my tip is ask for a room in the main building, it seems to be the difference of a good stay like me, or a bad stay like previous reviewers. \n\nOutside the room:\n- Breakfast was a disappointment, all they had were 2 cereals, some fruit, a waffle maker, and some of Super 8's signature cinnamon rolls (those are good!). They seem to have a container for biscuits and bagels but it was empty! Breakfast hours  are 6-9AM vs the normal 10am at most hotels. If I would've known that it was going to be a poor selection, I would've slept in an extra hour or so and stopped at Tim Horton's across the street, as check out isn't until 11. But hey, free is free. \n- Pool area was nice, water was a little on the cold side for my liking, especially since they filled in where the hot tub used to be in with cement. \n\nOverall this is not a fancy hotel, but it's great for a good night sleep or for the business traveler, wifi is great! Just make sure you get a room in the main building!\n\nAlso - This hotel is within walking distance to Alexander's Banquet Facility and right of I-94, very convenient!",4,positive

At that time I spoke with Kim, she had a look in their system, mentioned there were no other bookings and guaranteed our team 20 rooms for that week-end.  Kim mentioned that the other Manager, by the name of Chris, handled the group bookings and would be in touch shortly to work out the details.  I waited a month, spoke to Kim again, got the same guarantee that the rooms were blocked and the Managers had just been busy and would soon get to the  2014 bookings.  I continued to follow up (I can document the phone calls) each time being told Chris would return my call.  Eventually as September neared the calls were every two weeks in hopes that the players and their families could begin to make reservations.  Fed up, I pressed the front desk for some answers.  I was told there were no rooms available and nothing in my or the team's name.  Another promise that I would hear from Kim or Chris went unfulfilled.  I decided to contact the Super 8 Customer Service people who were apologetic but offered little other than an email to the motel asking them to respond to our questions.  Apparently since I had already waited 4 months for a reply another week wouldn't matter.  So a few days later I called again and demanded to speak to Kim.  As expected, some how, some way, the good people at the Wyndham Corporate offices had overidden their room blocks and removed our team's booking.  Kim was working to correct this problem but would have to get back to me.  Again no response so today I finally spoke to Chris who was clearly distancing himself from the problem and the 20 messages he had on his desk with my name and number.  The more I pressed, the more he knew but had little in the way of a solution other than wait until December to see if the corporate booking gets cancelled.  I was proactive in trying to make the booking, patient and understanding in waiting for a response.  As for this Super 8 and to some extent Wyndham\u002FSuper 8 Corporately, the behaviour is shameful at best brodering on dishonest.  If there was a mistake, an admission would have been appreciated.  Even better an offer to assist in finding alternate accomodations but there has been zero communication from this motel unless initiated from my end.

We did our online research and although this hotel was $30 more expensive than others at comparable levels we decided to spend the extra few dollars to stay here because they had the indoor pool and hot tub.  We checked on their website and other websites such as Hotels.com.  They all listed that they had all these amenities, and nowhere did it say that there were rooms being restored or that the pool, exercise room and hot tub would not be available on our date that we were interested in. I booked one day before I travelled so there should have been a notice on their website.\n\nApparently they had damage from Hurricane Sandy that shut down some rooms as well as the exercise room, pool and hot tub.  I do understand that this damage was caused by the storm, but why was it not sited on their website or anything?  Why are they charging a premium rate for their rooms when the amenities that are included in the price are not available?  That really upset me.\n\nThe room that we stayed in was pretty run down.  The bathroom had seen better days.  The sink in the bathroom had a very bad leak.  So much so that we had to put one of the towels down under the sink to soak up all the water that was leaking just from brushing our teeth and shaving.  Just the over all look of the bathroom seemed very old (floor, walls and ceiling)and seemed mouldy in the corners.\n\nWe found stuff in the recycle bin in the room, so I do question how thoroughly that the rooms are cleaned.  It can't be too easy to overlook something as obvious as the recycle bin, so you do start questioning how clean the sheets, carpet and other such things are in the room although they seemed to be adequate. \n\nWhile the woman at the desk was very pleasant, I was very disappointed in my stay.  To go ahead and pay an extra $30 per night thinking that you were getting the use of facilities that were not available is crookery.  At least inform people on your website or email people that have booked that facilities are not available.....and again, I booked 1 day before I travelled so there was no excuse why I did not know that these facilities were not available for me to use.\n\nSave the extra money and go to a different hotel as I certainly will not be going back to this hotel.",2,negative

While renovated, the rooms still shows their age but that has never been a problem or detracted from the stay.  This time the room just felt a bit more \""worn out\"" than previous rooms.  Of greater concern however was security.  The swing latch that most hotel rooms have had been modified by someone.  The \""ball\"" end mounted to the door had been filed down so it no longer engaged the \""slot\"" on the wall, basically if someone opened the door the latch would stop it, but they could simply reach through the gap of the partially opened door and push the latch out of the way thereby gaining access.  We slept with the ironing board leaning against the door such that it would fall over if anyone tried to open it.  The other issue with the room we had was the alarm clock started making weird noises at about 5am.  I could not find a way to get it to stop short of unplugging it.

This hotel has 2 different \""areas\"" - the tower with more traditional hotel set up, elevators etc.  The other half of the hotel attached to the conference centre is only 2 stories and has the advantage of being able to park right by your room, but the disadvantage of stairs only if you're on the second floor.  If you have mobility issues or very heavy luggage it's something to consider when checking in and selecting a room.  The location is nice, in Point Edward vs. Sarnia itself.  It's about a 10-15 minute drive into town where the mall and most of the restaurants are.  It is however near the waterfront parks and the Bluewater bridge and there are some nice waterfront restaurants nearby.  And of course only minutes from the famous Sarnia bridge fries (Many food trucks offering French Fries are located under the Bluewater bridge - a nice place to get an unhealthy dinner and go for a nice walk along the waterfront).  They also have a pool and a semi-decent fitness centre.",4,positive

Room was clean for the most part...some wallpaper slightly peeling and bathroom caulking need to be replaced in areas... but all in all ... more than acceptable for a couple of days.  Pool area was not sweeped until the morning we left nor the grounds cleaned. As well, the outside pool had alot of debris floating.  In the hotels defence, there are large poplar trees around the pool... but not once did we see someone clean the pool thru the days we were there...and we swam each morning as soon as the pool opened outside.... however, our kids grabbed the cleaning net and had fun doing it themselves... they are used to doing it at home when needed.  As far as my \""sliding comment\""... things such as loose, missing and extra tiles lying around the pool area... cracks and caulking needed around inside and outside pools... missing vent covers on inside pool area showing nasty looking walls, etc... I could go on... but these are minor things... and if you can look the other way as we do... you will be fine... I am sure these things will get fixed in time.  \nThe restaurant \""Bridges\""... stay away.

It was so bad that I had to take pictures as people would have assumed i was exaggerating how bad it was.\n- Rust all over vanity mirrors and lights\n- sink was clogged and wouldn't drain\n- bathroom door was so close to toilet that you needed to step into the bath tub to swing it closed from inside the bathroom\n- toilet seat was corroded and looked like it had a venereal rash\n- TV lost single every few minutes which would cut out the picture and sounds.  Might as well have not had a TV in the room.\n\nThey can claim that they didn't know how bad this stuff looks, but how would you clean the room and not notice this stuff.  Come on.

Asked if was a member of the IHG Rewards club, I said I wasn't and proceeded to sign up.  Was told that there would be some information regarding my enrolment placed under my room door, along with some coupons for breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  So far, so good.\n\nI was given my room keys and Internet access code and instructed where was best to park.  When I arrived at my room and opened the door the smell was really awful.  It initially smelled like sewer gas, but didn't seem to be coming from the bathroom.  Some further investigation revealed that the floor around the AC unit was soaked, and had been that way long enough to really smell up the room.  Went back to the front desk and given the keys to another room.  The new room didn't reek, but had obviously been a smoking room in the past.\n\nAs for the room itself, tired would be the best description.  Lots of patches in the ceilings and walls, and the floor tiles in the bathroom were past being kept decently clean looking due to their age.  The furnishings were updated and the linens clean, so no issues there.\n\nThe next morning I went to use the iron supplied with the room, but as soon as I touched it the metal base separated from the rest of the iron.  No big deal, but this wasn't just a case of spontaneous falling apart, it was obviously put away broken by the cleaning staff.  Walked up to the front desk to return the iron and request a new one.  Front desk staff said another would be brought to the room.  This took about twenty minutes which was time I hadn't counted on needing and ended up being late.\n\nOn my final day my receipt was not placed under my door, which is not a big deal but seems to be the norm with most major chains.  The IFG Rewards and breakfast coupons never materialized either.\n\nI've stayed at worse places, but usually not ones associated with a major chain and not at a price point north of $150 per night after taxes.  \n\nThe single most disappointing thing was finding out that my co-worker who arrived earlier that day was initially given the same foul smelling room, and it was still offered to me after he had informed staff that it reeked and refused to take it.  \n\nI don't typically get too twisted up over hotel stays, but there was just too much wrong with stay to not comment.\n\n",2,negative

When I arrived at the hotel, I was assigned a regular room with a Queen bed (with no price reduction).  I was told it was because they had to do \""room balancing\""... a term I have not heard in at least 2 weeks \u002F month in hotels for over 30 years, and the desk attendant also told me my room type was a \""request\"" but only confirmed when I got there!!  \n\nI pulled the reservation printout from my bag when I went back to my vehicle and sure enough .. I was correct.  When I went back to the desk, the clerk called the manager on duty, Hillary, who put me in room 103 which was a very nice room of the type I had booked. \n\n It was fine for the first night of my 2-night stay but I am having a horrible night 2.  The room is one of those that connects to another room and there is almost no sound barrier between my room and the one next door. I can hear every word spoken in the next room and their TV, and I am sure they can hear my TV also, so I suspect that my neighbor is not enjoying his night unless he also likes my TV choices.  \n\nI had to put a towel by the door to block the somewhat unpleasant smell coming under the door.  Thankfully, I also discovered that I can open the window a touch and turn on the ventilation system to get rid of that.\n\nThe rooms 103 and 105 would be very good for a family travelling, since they connect but I would stay away from them if I ever stayed here again as a solo traveler.\n\nParking spots need to be re-evaluated.  When you leave the entrance next to room 101, there is a handicap access ramp which I believe needs to be left open.  It is also a necessary way for many guests to get their luggage to their vehicles.  HOWEVER.... there is a parking spot by the ramp and there was a van with a trailer hitch parked there both nights I stayed, so anyone who did not have the capacity to carry bags would have had to go to the main entrance.  \n\nNow for the good....  The room I had was very clean, had a mini fridge, flat screen TV and a great shower.  The portable phone was also very convenient.  The room faces the parking lot on the first floor and a relatively busy street so the privacy drapes were nice to have.  Room service was very good, with a great breakfast selection.  My breakfast was delivered in less than 15 minutes and was excellent!  For dinner you are better off to go to the restaurant where the selection is still somewhat limited but all the food is so well prepared and the service is friendly and a lot of local selections.  \n\nThe only other comment I have is not just for this hotel.  It ticks me off when a hotel makes all the advertising noise about being so green but has Styrofoam cups for the coffee and plastic glasses in the room instead of reusable glasses and real cups.",3,negative

I arrived early, so my room was not ready, so I took a drive to the river and downtown Point Edward (I believe the hotel is technically in Point Edward as well). There are a few local shops there, but the highlight is the park along the river near the bridge. So much to see and great views of Port Huron.\n\nWhile away, I received a call from the hotel desk clerk (forgot his name, sorry!) who let me know the room was ready. That's a nice touch- never had that before. My room was also upgraded to the jacuzzi suite, since they had it on file I liked that room, and I am a platinum member. It was exactly how I remembered! The jacuzzi stil feels nice, bed is comfortable, and bathroom is good. I watched the afternoon Jays game (they didn't have the Tigers game sadly) and relaxed.\n\nWifi is very strong, by the way, No issues.\n\nLeft for the night to attend a poker tournament at the casino- a very short drive on Venetian. Stuck around a while but not good enough to win a prize. Oh well.\n\nI did not use the pool- the indoor is slightly elevated from the ground which is interesting, and it was only in the 60s during the day so too cold to use the outdoor pool in my eyes.

Check-in was quick and efficient; however, when we arrived at the room, it was a handicap room, even though we had made no such request.  This would not have been a problem had it not been for my 6 year old daughter.  The toilet in the handicap room is significantly higher than a non-handicap toilet which prevented my daughter from using it without our assistance in lifting her up.  Therefore, a modification which was installed to accomodate the handicap, was in fact, a barrier to my daughter.  We tried to get another room; however, the person at the front desk said that the room is already assigned when using Hotwire.  Hence, I guess Hotwire users are cared about less at this hotel.  Additionally, when it was time for bed, we noticed that the pull out sofa bed sheets were dirty (never changed from the previous guests).  We called the front desk and a courteous young man was dispatched to our room and corrected the problem.  Kudos to this young man; however, the original housekeeping staff needs some direction.\nFinally, at about 2:00 am we were woke up by loud conversations and kids running up and down the hallway.  We called the front desk and security took care of this problem within minutes.    Thanks to them also.\nEven with the positive, I would likely not return to this hotel because the differential treatment given to Hotwire guests.

I chose the Holiday Inn because it had both an indoor and outdoor pool and a hot tub.  The indoor pool & hot tub were very nice - clean and comfortable temperatures.  We also enjoyed sitting in the sunshine at the outdoor pool, although the pool deck and yard area looked a little uncared for - could have been much tidier.  Our room in the older section was 'tired' but very clean and adequate.  However, the patio area all across that section is very worn - not at all inviting.  Next time we would book a room in the tower.  The breakfast buffet in the Bridges dining room was very good - lots of beautiful fruit & berries, the usual bacon, sausage, eggs - all hot and tasty and some very nice pastries.  Coffee - a full pot left on our table - was wonderful!  The staff - from front desk to servers to maintenance people met in the corridors were so friendly.  My only complaint was that at 8:30am - 5 minutes after I had gotten in and was enjoying a soak in the hot tub - a young lady came along and said I had to get out because it was time to drain, clean & refill it.  This was very disappointing as I had booked the hotel because it had a hot tub (sore muscles and arthritic joints appreciate the jetted hot water!).  The fitness area is open from 5:30am til 11pm and  I think that maintenance should be done after closing so that hotel guests can use the facilities during the hours they are open.

On the negative side, rooms are a little tired (so far I've stayed in the older, 'executive' wing) and probably worth the 'upgrade' to the newer rooms.  Rooms are a little noisy (recommend upper floor).  Bedding also is a little on the budget end - and so far I've pretty much had to 're-make' the bed every night because they tuck so much in at thee bottom there is nothing left at the top. Strange - but this seems to be a consistent thing!  The restaurants ambitions far exceed its execution and is over-priced for the quality of its offerings.

Perhaps house keeping should check this before the guests arrive!\n\nThe bathroom was small with the sink area inside, which makes it harder if there are two trying to get ready in the morning.

The hotel itself was fine, clean, relatively updated, about what I would expect from a 3 star hotel. However, the customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. After shutting off my TV around 11 pm, I realized that the walls of this hotel were extremely thin and every little noise from the hallway could be heard clearly inside my room. I called the front desk at midnight to ask if there was something they could do, they told me that there was a meeting down the hall from my room. I found this hard to believe, I asked when this meeting would be done as it was very loud with doors opening and closing every five seconds and people talking loudly, not to mention beer bottles clanging, (what kind of meeting was this?) Lisa proceeded to tell me that it should be wrapped up shortly. I then tried to fall asleep once again with no luck, this continued until 3:00 in the morning with me calling twice. I asked Lisa if there was a noise policy at this hotel and she said she didn't know and I would have to ask the manager in the morning. (very educated staff) In the morning, as I was up all night I began to get ready at 6 am and left for my business meeting. When I returned I went to the restaurant with my coupon and received even more 'great' service...hair with my toast...I decided to leave at that point and when I checked out I asked to speak with the manager. She argued with me about the occurrence from the night before and then offered to comp my room, which is something that should have been offered right away, This comp would be useful except I didn't pay for the room, my company did, so I guess I saved them money but had a terrible night sleep and it truly impacted my early morning meeting.

We arrived around 5pm which was our first overnight stop on our way from Kingston to Calgary.  Around 9pm a couple next door were engaging in intimate activities with the door ajar that could be heard clearly into our room.  A little while later l left to get a drink with my four month old baby only to find the our hall full of marijuana smoke (even though we called ahead and confirmed the hotel was non smoking!) the hotel staff on duty went down and agreed it was full of smoke and asked the guests to smoke outside.  They moved us up a floor where men were drinking beer in the halls and singing, it was at that point I knew it wasn't a good environment to get any sleep, especially not for a baby and we made the choice to leave.  I understand somethings in a hotel are beyond control, but it was the terrible customer service that has prompted me to share this.  The hotel staff watched my husband and I take several trips back and forth from our room to the lobby with our suitcases, a baby, and a dog and not one offered to help us carrying anything or get us a dolly. They also just stood there in the empty lobby and watched us try to load everything back into our SUV.  They didn't charge us for the room (which makes sense because we didn't get to sleep!) but they did not comp our meal or give us anything type of incentive to ever come back (which we don't plan on) If you're looking for a good time that involves excessive amounts of alcohol, encounters with the door open, or marijuana this might be your place!

We came to the Hampton and were greeted by two wonderful ladies and after explaining to them what had happened at the other hotel they informed me they only had the king size bed with a sofa left. They waited patiently for me to find the best deal last minute through my booking website and processed everything for me shortly afterwards. This hotel was great, the food was pretty awesome which saved me money buying 4 people breakfast. Every morning the staff would ask me how my night was just small talk and acknowledgment that I was a guest. It was a comfortable feeling in the room. Everything was new, clean, and well kept. The king bed was comfortable, however, my friend got the pullout bed and said it wasn\u2019t too comfortable to sleep it (but it was all they had as we needed something last minute). The pool was pretty good, the kids enjoyed the convenience of swimming and it was pretty quiet so we had our privacy. Plus down the street from the casino was a bonus.

data/ca/2039337/9587762/401453129.html,Hampton Inn by Hilton Sarnia/Point Edward,"""This review covers two recent stays at the newly built Hampton Inn in Sarnia\u002FPoint Edward.  \n\nOur family lived in Sarnia for 13+ years and recently moved away.  We've returned a few times to see friends of ours and therefore needed a place to stay.  We figured newer was better and have stayed twice at the Hampton Inn.  We are also Hhonors members, which influenced our decision. \n\nUnfortunately, both of our visits have had issues that in my mind were not handled well by staff and make me question how quick the hotel was put together and opened. \n\nDuring our first visit we encountered: only one of two elevators in service, which at busy times caused significant delays waiting for the elevators... Poor breakfast service in the morning, when the buffet area was busy... super hot hallways and in general poor temperature control throughout the building... a large millipede crawling on our ceiling when we woke up in the morning... and no one at the checkout counter upon checking out.  We mentioned some of these things to the staff, but in general, no one seemed to be treating these issues with urgency from a customer satisfaction perspective.  \n\nOur second visit seemed to indicate improvements had been made as building temperature control was better, the breakfast area seemed better staffed, both elevators were in service,and there was someone seemingly always at the checkin checkout desk.  That being said, the day we needed to checkout out, a father and daughter got trapped in one of the elevators.  This took both elevators out of service and required the fire department to be called.  It appears an elevator repair person was called, but the fire department ended up needing to ladder the people out of the elevator shaft.  \n\nThe desk staff seemed very frazzled by the situation and no one seemed to know which maintenance keys were for the and it didn't appear anyone was continuously interacting with the family or the mother who was waiting on the ground floor for her husband and daughter.  There was very poor communication with the hotel guests that the elevators were out of service (they should have sent a voicemail message to each room or put a message on the elevator doors on each floor rather than leaving guests standing for elevators that were never coming).  As this occurred close to checkout time and went on for over an hour, there should have been better efforts made for sure!  We had to carry all our baggage down the fire stairwell to checkout, and we had our son's mountain bike with us as he had a race that weekend.  Luckily, the building was only 6 stories.  We were on the 5th floor, but it is still quite a task carrying a mountain bike down 5 flights of a fire stairwell.  So all in all, quite a poorly handled situation the morning of our checkout.  \n\nWe assumed after some of the issues during the first visit that they were just \""working out the bugs\"" of the new place and had new staff \""learning the ropes\"".  Some improvements have occurred... But this latest experience leaves me wondering about adequate staff training and the overall quality of building construction (one elevator out of service during the first visit and one elevator stuck during the second visit).   \n\nNot sure we'll give this place a third chance.

However what we got upon arrival was room 402, the first room close to the ever so busy bridge having trucks queuing until the early hours.  How can you sleep with this noise?  We were told then we could have chosen the room online (to a forest\u002Fpark looking at the back that was so amazingly quiet) but how could we have known which side of the hotel was to be quiet?  Hence us requesting a quiet room away from noises as we tend to ask all hotels around the world.... and you know what?

Of course the hotel is going to reply saying whatever suits them, but at least you have been advised what room to chose: the hotel does not care about email\u002Ftelephone calls from Hilton members, as our experience proved, do you think will care about you?

We have stayed at many through the years; this may have been the very best one we have ever seen.  The front desk personnel, both in the evening and the next morning when we checked out, extremely helpful and very personable.  The rooms were excellently laid out, the beds remarkably comfortable, the wi-fi both free and seamless, the free cookies in the evening delicious, and the breakfast well-planned and varied. No one, unless they were the most picky of picky eaters, would ever leave the breakfast room hungry.\n\nThe Hampton Inn is one of the first buildings one sees after passing through Canadian customs from Port Huron, Michigan heading east.  It is easy to reach and extremely quick in the morning to leave when one wants to get back on the 403 expressway.

data/ca/2039337/183008/289680211.html,Comfort Inn,"""Its cheaper for a reason. We chose this hotel because it was mid range, looked at motel 6 first but decided against it because of some online reviews, and warnings and decided on the slightly more expensive comfort inn.\n\nFirst issue was asking for a non smoking room and getting one on a smoking floor, at the other end of the hallway. The room itself didn't have a strong smell of smoke, but the hallway was pretty bad, and the room had a strange, unnatural odor. I'm thinking it was febreeze as I heard the maid aggressively spritzing a room as I was walking down the hall.\n\nIts very dated, but clean for the most part, the breakfast is the same tired old circular shapped eggs, sausages, cereal, and waffles. And the worst coffee I've ever tasted. We stayed 5 days and it was the exact same thing, every day.\n\nThe mattress and A\u002FC were the worst part, terribly uncomfortable and very old. No spring, no cushion, almost like being directly on the box spring, the blankets also should be replaced, a little scratchy. The A\u002FC was so loud and alarming when it went on, it would wake me from my sleep, I had to end up getting ear plugs to drown it out!\n\nI travel quite a bit for work and generally stay with the best western, and have always been happy...I really shouldn't have tried anywhere new.\n\nAgain, nothing was terrible, but nothing was great (or that good to be honest).

Unfortunately we would have only booked for 1 night because we did not play hockey on the Sunday.

As well, instead of just replenishing the toiletries they threw out the shampoo and conditioner that was in the shower that were half full. I find this to be a completely unnecessary.

data/ca/2039337/183008/316179536.html,Comfort Inn,"""This was a last minute booking so I wasn't really sure what to expect.  Using GPS, it's not hard to get to the intersection it's at.  If you're winging it and going by written directions...it's a bit tricky once you get close to the location.  Someone mentioned that it's hard to find and that's hard to argue.  It is in an easy to get to part of the city, just a little tricky to find when going off the signs. The back driveway where I entered was filled with nasty potholes and dimly lit.  The parking along the unmarked main entrance is one long row and there's spots at either end and the aforementioned overflow and it's holes.  Because there's no sign where I entered it's hard to know if you're going in the right door.\n\nThat being said, once I got inside it was pretty nice.\n\nThe staff member that greeted me the night of October 3rd was super friendly and very welcoming.  She made sure I had all the information I needed to know about the amenities, free breakfast time, WiFi and such and she was just a pleasure to deal with.  While at most places the staff are courteous, I wouldn't describe many of them as friendly.  She was definitely friendly and it was a really nice touch after a long day on the road.  \n\nThe lobby was clean and neat and the property itself while a little hit and miss outside, was well kept inside.   Being right next to a major freeway, you'd expect it to be a bit noisy but I didn't have any issues in my room with traffic noise and I was on the freeway side.\n\nThe room I stayed in; #336: was reasonably nice but I'm still unsure how I feel about the value vs price.  While it was reasonably well furnished, the definite star of the room was the king size bed with what seemed to be a memory foam top.  It was extremely comfortable and once I was on it...I really didn't want to leave it.  The room featured a nice large desk, a couch, fridge and microwave with a well stocked coffee maker on top and a Smart TV that had a great screen.  Wifi worked very well and I had no issues with speed while using Netflix.\n\nThe only major complaint I had was the room was severely lacking in accessible power outlets and since I travel with a tablet, phone, and laptop; it was almost impossible to reach a power outlet in a convenient spot.  One was behind the very heavy couch, another behind the fridge\u002Fmicrowave in the other corner of the room and the rest were occupied by lamps and in difficult to reach places.  It was also a little odd not having outlets at the desk.\n\nI won't lie. The bathroom was pretty small. It had a fairly nice shower\u002Ftub combo but mine had a weird slant towards the drain that you could physically feel while standing in it.  I don't know if that's an intentional design by the manufacturer or an installation problem but I would be concerned about having elderly people or anyone with balance issues standing in it.  I have a bit of a balance issue myself and I did feel very awkward standing in it.  Again, it's a very small bathroom and you definitely couldn't get two people in the bathroom comfortably at the vanity as it is such a narrow space.\n\nSome soaps and lotions were provided but towels were your standard lower end motel fare.  Not particularly thick or soft but clean and plentiful.  The bedding was clean and comfortable and there were plenty of pillows.  My room was warmer than I like it when I arrived but the heating\u002Fair conditioning controls were easy to use and I had no trouble cooling it down quickly.\n\nI was there on a Saturday night and the building was very quiet and peaceful.  I had a great sleep and woke up feeling very refreshed.  Again, the bed was a huge selling point of this room.  I've slept in a LOT of hotels and this may have been the most comfortable bed I've slept in and at the end of the day, that's what's most important.\n\nI didn't get up in time to take advantage of the free breakfast which ran from 6am to 10am (come on...it's the weekend...extend that an hour) so I can't comment on it save to say it was in what looked like a pretty nice room.\n\nCheckout was easy and quick and the staff member that checked me out was also very friendly and helpful.\n\nTo sum it all up, while the bed was incredible and the staff exceptional, the few little details I mentioned: the outlets, the slanty shower, VERY small bathroom and poorly maintained rear parking lot kept me from giving this four out of five.  I paid $115 including taxes which is reasonable for a well maintained chain hotel but maybe just a bit expensive for a place in that particular type of location and with the issues I mentioned.\n\nI was happy with my stay and would recommend it wholeheartedly if the minor details were looked after in the future.   Compared to the Super 8 in Sarnia which I've stayed at that was almost the same price, it's a palace.  Compared to the Holiday Inn I previously stayed at just around the corner that was a few dollars more, its a fixer upper to a certain extent but the room was definitely nicer in terms of decor than the Holiday Inn's offering.   It's biggest failing is it's location being freeway adjacent and there is literally nothing to the property outside of the building.  It's a long, boathouse style building that's surrounded by asphalt and just a few decorative flowers.  No lawn that I could see or grounds of any kind.  Just asphalt.",3,negative

She was coming home for Christmas. We drove all day through Michigan in a terrible snow storm. When we crossed the border into Sarnia the storm was even worse. It was about 10:30pm and we headed towards Guelph on the 403. After a few miles we realized they were closing the road and headed back to Sarnia. We were one of the last to check into the Motel that night. It was so warm and cozy after that terrible trip. We had weather and road reports from the front desk along with everything else we needed to bed down for the night. Next morning we found out there was nothing moving in or out of town. Some of the staff was staying on double shifts to cover for the people who couldn\u2019t make it in. They were all so understanding and helpful. On the second day they even brought in pizza and snacks for those that couldn\u2019t get out. Almost every time we went to the desk Barb was there helping people contact their friends and coordinate people who were looking for ways out of town. My cell phone went dead and they even found a charger for me. After three days stranded in town the 403 re-opened and we set out for home again. We were sad to leave and we weren\u2019t the only ones sharing hugs with the staff when we left.  It was one of the biggest disasters last winter in Southern Ontario and the Comfort Inn in Sarnia made it our best adventure of the year.

Interestingly we found out that a neighbouring golf course was giving customers FREE water on their course bc of the heat...guess where we will be golfing next?! \n\nHey Forest...CUSTOMER SERVICE MATTERS!",1,negative

I have seen in many hotels that we have stayed at that they charge for public use of the pool facilities.

This hotel may have been a 2 star in the past, but it is much, much better than a 2 star today.  That is why other reviews are so positive. \n\nThe hotel provides exceptional value for money.  Here is why:\n-The common areas of the hotel are completely refurbished.  \n-Our room (219) was also completely refurbished (new bathroom, new carpets, new furniture).  They must have gutted it and rebuilt the room from scratch.  Very clean and comfortable! The rest of floor was refurbished.\n-Location at first sight may look a bit dodgy as it is located on the harbor.  However it is directly connected to huge park (Centennial Park), beside a wonderful waterfront pub and public marina with direct walking access to the city\u2019s waterfront boardwalk.  Very safe (we were born and raised in Sarnia and return every year to visit family so we know the area).  We watched a Canadian Coast Guard vessel come into the harbor and tie up several hundred yards from the hotel.  \n-The hotel is less than 4 minutes drive from the extraordinary public park that is under the bridge to the USA.   The bridge park is free and not to be missed.  HUGE ships from around the world have to pass through the extraordinarily narrow channel that drains Lakes Superior and Huron.

It almost seems like a home away from home at this point.  I would evaluate it as follows:\n\nPros:\n- Interesting waterfront location.  The nearby grain and maintenance docks for large ships may not be super trendy (this is no marina), but they do provide an interesting and unique setting.  Anyone who has a passing interest in ships will find this kind of cool.\n- Clean, very well maintained rooms.\n- A friendly, almost family atmosphere sometimes missing at larger chain hotels in this same market.\n- Rooms are very quiet due to 'unique' brick construction in the hallways.  The location is also in quite a relaxed setting away from major traffic routes (which are still easy to access).\n- Excellent value for the money.\n\nCons:\n- Although they are very clean and well maintained, the room style is somewhat dated and Spartan.  The hallways are covered in a textured brick pattern that I have not seen elsewhere and could be considered kind of 70's.  However, it makes for very quiet rooms and hallways.\n- There is nothing that really makes this hotel exciting or terribly romantic, so it is probably more suited to business trips or others seeking a good place to stay at reasonable prices rather than as a romantic get away or a weekend destination for a family with children.\n",4,positive

data/ca/155011/1876701/128551432.html,Fauld&#39;s Motel Sarnia,"""My wife and I were looking for a simple, inexpensive place to stay on a Saturday night after seeing a concert, and this motel seemed to fit the bill. This is an old-school L-shaped motel, the kind where they still give you an actual physical key to your room. We paid about $50 for our stay. There are no queen- or king-sized beds on this property -- it's all double beds.\n\nBoth check-in and check-out were a bit odd, as the front door was locked both times -- we had to ring the doorbell and wait a minute for the manager to come in (via the adjoining unit, where it appeared he lived with his family) and unlock the door to let us in. I did not get the impression that the door was locked due to the area being unsafe -- there are several motels on this road, and it seemed to be a fairly safe, well-trafficked area -- but rather, it seemed that this motel simply doesn't see a whole lot of regular business, and so there doesn't seem to be a great desire on the part of management to have the front desk manned constantly. In fact, during our stay on a Saturday night, I counted only three other cars in the entire parking lot.\n\nOur room itself was clean and basic, with a desk, nightstands on both sides of the bed, small table, 19\"" square TV, and an updated bathroom (new countertop, new shower). The bed and sheets were clean. The main problem with the room: there was no heat. There was a positively ancient radiator underneath the front window, but it did not operate (and didn't appear to have been operable in many years). There was a window AC unit above the old radiator, but it did not have a heat function. We stopped by the front desk to ask if they might have a space heater, but once again, the door was locked and there was nobody around to let us in this time. It seemed pretty strange that we would even have to ask for a heater, as the temperature outside was still pretty cold -- you would think that the room would already have a space heater inside waiting for us, or else that the manager would've offered us one right up front (without us having to ask).\n\nDuring the night and early morning, we could hear a bit of traffic coming and going -- not sure if this was in the motel parking lot itself, or if it was on the neighboring street, but it was loud enough inside the room to be noticeable.\n\nOverall, this motel served the function of \""a clean bed to crash in,\"" and it was inexpensive. But beyond that, I would not recommend this place, as it felt like the comfort of its guests was not really a priority -- this felt more like a private residence where they also happen to put up the occasional guest for the night rather than a full-fledged motel.",3,negative

The hotel location is fine and from the outside it might look a little dated but on the inside the renovations are very nice. The staff is great and after a mix-up from my travel agency, my room was switched to what I had asked for with no problem. I'm a service technician and work on the road and sleep in hotels about 80% of the year. I do agree with what others said about the doors being old and all plus carrying a key is a little more complicated than a card key but if you rate the hotel low for that reason then you probably are a little too complicated. The breakfast room is very nice and the continental breakfast is not superb but it does the job very well. Rooms are clean and well-furnished for the price of the rooms. Wi-Fi internet works great and is easy to connect to. I have nothing wrong to say in general for this hotel.\n\nNow here is some advice for Howard Johnson from someone that stays in A LOT of hotels:\n\nThe card that is on the night stand for the bed linen service is a great idea but Howard Johnson goes about it the wrong way. Instead of asking me to put that card on the bed to tell you that I don't need to get the linens change, you should do like most of the other hotels do and change the linens every 4 days except if the person puts the card on the bed. It's a hassle to remember to put the card every day because I'm environmentally friendly\n\nFor an environmentally friendly hotel, you should supply a small recycle bin like many hotels do.\n\nI would look into serving a hot breakfast like many hotels are switching to because it will attract a lot of customers such as myself who will stay for a few days to a few weeks and also it is proven that it will attract regular one day customers over competitors with the continental breakfast.\n\nIt was just a few ideas for what I like in a hotels when I stay at them.\n\nAll in all I'm very happy at the moment with everything at this hotel and would recommend it without a problem to anyone.",4,positive

data/ca/155011/1672190/128392827.html,Howard Johnson Inn Sarnia,"""We decidedto visit Sarnia at the last minute, and therefore did not have reservations in advance.  We called upon the Internet reviews and found that there were two very different levels there - $100 + and a $50 price point.  Many of the $50 reviews were scary sounding, but the Ho Jo's sounde very good.  I gambled on an Expedia bid and was very happy upon arrival.  There are two main areas of Sarnia - the downtown \u002F Bridge area, and what is known as the Golden Mile to the East about 3 - 4 miles from the city center.  This property is in the Golden Mile area.  Specifically it is right next to the Ontario-Managed Horse Track, which we learned will be closed by the end of April.  (Something abou the Ontario government not wanting to manage its gambling establishments any longer, and hoping to sell them to private companies.)  \n\nThe HoJo's is on London Line Road along with many other small \""mom and pop\"" type motels.  All the motels in this area seem dated.  I presume that these were constructed 30 - 40 years ago, perhaps when the horse track was opened?  Not knowing the area at all I have no idea.  I guess if a number of semi trucks were parked in the lots of some of these motels I would not be surprised.  These may have been fine properties, but I could see us spending an hour or two brousing them, going into rooms to check and so forth.  Having the reservation made was a good thing.  \n\nThis area has a great deal of new growth.  There are two prominent restaurants across the street.  Johns and Big Fish are right there.  The HoJo's no longer has its own restaurant, as it is under renovations.  there is also a WalMart \u002F new mall area just west of this location.  Although the horse track is closing prosperity is still there!\n\nThe Motel itself is an older property but has recently undergone renovations.  There were new windows, carpet, tile, wallpaper, fixtures.  There are glimpses of older elements such as the doors and some trim work.  Everything was recently painted.  \n\nTo capture the title of this review - think of an older property that has been brought up to a $120 - $150 a night standard while retaining the $50 - $70 price tag.  When we walked in we saw a bright lobby with nw features, fresh, not otherwise dated. the staff was very friendly.  A trip to our room was down a basically new hall.  There was a real key, versus a cardkey, which prompts an obvious concern about the potential for security issues from key copies.  When we opened our door I was amazed.  Spotless and inviting.  the bed, sheets, blankets, pillows all seemed new.  Decorations were all to current standards.  There was a flat screen TV, a fridge, the carpet was spotless.  As many newer properties sport there was no bedspread, just the blanket wrapped top and bottom in sheets and a decostative fabric band across the foot to the bed.  The bathroom was clean and updated as well with new tiles, a curved curtain rod, a new tub, counter top, sik and so on.  After seeing \""Hotel Impossible I took a clean wash cloth and rubbed it on the tile and grout in a few places.  There was not a spec of dirt.  GOOD JOB housekeeping staff!  One note - there is no iron\u002Fironing board or hair dryer in the rooms. I'd presume those were at the front desk?  We did not need them so we did not ask.  The room was small, to 1980's room standards.  What do you get a room for at this price?  this was very clean - imaculate as a matter of fact, albeing a somewhat smaller room we felt secure and did not worry about creatures running about when the lights were off.\n\nThere is a complimentary continental breakfast offered.  That fell a little short of expectations.  It was, well, basic.  muffings, croisants, jelly, butter, coffee, juice and so for th were there, along with two kinds of cereal.  It was all just kind of spartan.  The muffins may have been Tim Hortons - as they were not perfect \u002F store bought variety.  Taht was a nice touch.  We prefer robust coffee, but the coffee served i nthe breakfast area was watery.  \n\nAbout the only negatives to cite besides the door lock and breakfast was that there is no ice machine, and the ceiling in our room had prior water damage and had crude repair attemted but failed.  \n\nTo get ice you have to go to the front desk.  The desk clerk has to leave the desk and walk the length of the hall to the closed restaurant where there is a single ice machine inside the costuction area.\n\nThe bathroom above the tub in the bathroom had obvious water damage from the room above. A repair had been tried bot paint was starting to pop off, there was some bubbling of the drywall, and a couple water stains had bled though the paint.  That was the only negative to the room itself, and I had to serch for that!\n\nWe would retun to this property in the future.",5,positive

This past weekend turned out less than favourable.  Room was great, etc.\nHowever, my husband and I were a bit disappointed for a couple of reasons.  They may seem trivial, but did factor in to our being comfortable.  When we arrived on Saturday, we went to the motel to see if our room was ready.  No one was at the front desk so my husband called on the phone, we were rudely told that no one gets their room before 3 p.m. which we are aware of but thought we would try.  The man told my husband they were doing a major cleaning and no one was allowed in any rooms.  That's fine but he didn't even come out to tell us.  Also there was absolutely no activity in any rooms to our acknowledge.  I returned 3 times more that day and still no one at the desk.  I finally seen someone at 5 p.m.\nThe lady then told me I couldn't have a room because my card had been denighed.  When in fact someone had written down the wrong number.  This was embarrassing because others were standing in the lobby and heard her.\nWe were give room 117, when we had asked for 119 and were told it was empty for Saturday night.  When we got there we were told the people who had it Friday night decided to stay and that they wanted to stay in that room.  That's fine, but I remember one time we stayed, decided to stay a 3rd night and had to move.  Why are some treated different than others.\nOne thing I must remember also is not to ever have any of those 3 front rooms, especially in the winter time.  I know it is no ones fault on the weather, but to remove snow with either blade or shovel at 6 a.m. when someone is sleeping and on holidays and is then waken up because the noise was so loud.\nAlso one last thing, when someone is being trained, make sure they know which rooms are empty and when.  The last morning again we were awakened by someone trying to open our door.  Thank goodness I put the bar across at night or they would have barged right in on us.\nWill we come again?  Of course!

The management, in all its wisdom, had arranged for work to be done on the roof, and had given absolutely no warning to the guests. I called down to complain, and encountered an incredibly rude desk person, who attempted to blame me for complaining. The duty manager was just as rude, and offered absolutely no compensation. We quickly packed up to leave, and found our car completely covered in dust and debris from the roofers. It was so bad, we immediately had to go to a car wash. Fortunately, there was one across the street (maybe this kind of thing represents a significant portion of their business). We would never, ever go to this place again.

We went out for an hour or two and the boxes were still there. We reiterated our concerns.   When I mentioned talking to the local police or fire authorities the boxes disappeared pretty quickly.  THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD SAFETY PROCEDURES! \n\nThis property really needs more attention!   My bed was lumpy, the sink drain was slow, the toilet didn't work great, the carpets were old and rumpled, with trip hazards.

We got the room with the jet tub which only comes with a king bed. \n\nThe room does not include a chair of any sorts other than a desk chair that hurts your back after an hour of sitting in it, little to no padding with wood frame.

I\u2019m only 5\u2019 and had to leap up to sit on the bed, really no chairs for the guests? \n\nThe first room was recently remodeled. That was obvious as the light fixtures were not installed and the painter was not finished. When I turned on the jet tub large black junk came out and into the water. There were no luggage racks to set suitcases on. When I called the front desk to complain the lady was super professional and offered another room, it was 9:30 already and we had unpacked.

My sister and I were pretty upset that the parents ignored their children and used all the towels as they ran in and out of the pool room to the dining area soaking the floor. When I asked the front desk for more towels I was informed that there weren\u2019t any clean on property and she would go wash some. Later I saw the front desk clerk folding towels and then she gave me some. She was very apologetic and nice. If parents are going to be so rude and ignore the sign that says no one under 14 in Jacuzzi they need to be asked to leave by staff. RUDE PARENTS with unruely children were all over. This is a big deal to those of us who want to soak in a hot Jacuzzi and relax. The kids got food all over the floor in the dining area that you had to walk through and was still there at breakfast.\n\nWe tried to play some games in the game room, only one of 5 worked. 2 ate our coins one had an out of order sign on it, one was unplugged.\n\nWhen I checked out I asked for a manager and there wasn\u2019t one on duty.

Huge play area next to the pool was a great surprise. The hotel is very convenient. Located next to the expressway and I-25 I believe. The hotel is trying to improve and you can see it. The breakfast is good. Eggs, homemade waffles were a plus. I was between a 4 and a 5 so gave this a 5 but more like a 4.5 which is still excellent. I would stay here again for sure.

Took us 10 minutes to go half a mile. Once we finally arrived at our destination after our two hour drive enduring construction and the local traffic, I was pleasantly surprised at the amenities we saw while waiting to be checked in. My 4 year old son was with me and I pointed out the pool for him to go look at. He ran over to the window and also informed me there was a play structure inside as well. I then gestured toward a hallway in which I noticed an arcade. My husband took our son in to play while I checked in.\n\nThe young lady working the desk was efficient and friendly. I grabbed our keys and headed upstairs. We located our room and attempted several times to unlock the door with no luck. I wandered back downstairs and she reprogrammed our keys. \n\nOur room was adequate. The beds were small and hard. The pillows unsupportive. We freshened up and headed out for dinner. \n\nWe finally made it back after ensuing the cruise traffic again and headed down to the pool. The pool was absolutely frigid. The hot tub was more the temperature of a tepid bath than that of a spa. It was nice to see that an employee was keeping the area well stocked with towels and relatively clean.\n\nWe called it a night around 11. After I had fallen asleep, my husband heard a couple from across the hall engaging in coitus. At 2:30 a.m. I was woken by the guests in the room adjoining ours. They were bickering. I could hear every word clearly. They're argument continued especially once the man had left the toilet seat up and the girl had promptly fell in when she sat down. It escalated when she realized he had also urinated on the rim and had not cleaned it. I can only assumed what happened behind those walls, but it all of a sudden fell silent and u heard the man scream 'you like that.' At this point, they had also woken my husband. Something you do not want to do. Once the Bear is waken, there is no hope. He stood at the end of our bed staring at the door connecting the two rooms. He pounded firmly, told them to be quiet (paraphrasing) at which time you heard the woman begin to cry. I called the front desk and they hurriedly arrived at the room and told the couple they needed to be quiet because they were disturbing the other guests. The arguement subsided, but you could still hear their entire conversation thence forth.\n\nThe next morning, we headed downstairs for breakfast. A decent choice of food including strawberry waffles! A welcome addition to the usual Belgian option. Scrambled eggs, bisquits and gravy, hash browns and your usual carb loaded choices. For all you health nuts, like myself, there were hard boiled eggs, yogurt and fruit.\n\nAt checkout, the man at the front desk listened to our story of horror from the nights stay and rendered us a discount for the trouble.  He did inform us that the hotel is undergoing construction to reduce the noise resistance and they are all done with the 4th floor. (So you should definitely ask to stay on the 4th floor) If it were not for the staff, I would be giving this location only 2  stars instead of the 3 I rated.",3,negative

This woke us up repeatedly.  And the windows are single-pained sliders (at least they open!) so you can hear truck noise from the highway as well. The earlier reviewer who mentioned the filthy window tracks? They are still filthy.\nThe lobby has been redone and looks great, but the rooms badly need an update as well.   \nWifi worked great, Jacuzzi worked great, bed was comfortable,and the pool looked very inviting (especially for kids) but we did not use it. \nOverall, the hotel is adequate (if you are a sound sleeper), but we would not stay again.",3,negative

We generally stay at the full service Marriott properties but unfortunately there is no full service ones in this area so I chose this one based on the good reviews on tripadvisor. To be fair, I would never compare this hotel to a JW Marriott or Ritz Carlton, but it is fine if you just want a place to sleep. And I think what is more impressive is the service at this hotel - everyone is very nice and friendly and always try their best to help.\n\nNow let me know you some special experience\u002Fstory we had- After check-in, we decided to go to red lobster for dinner. I had a GPS but it ever failed us twice before, so I got the habit of double checking maps online before going to a new place just to make sure. Weirdly enough, the wi fi internet (free) stopped working minutes after I got online; so I called the front desk and was told that they would reset the network. After waiting for more than 15 minutes the service didn't restore and the kids became impatient since they were hungry. So we decided to just rely on the GPS - You know what? The GPS (Garmin 265w in case you wonder; and since then I really started boycotting Garmin) led us on the bridge to Canada! What is worse is that you can't turn back once you are on the bridge. And the worst thing is that we didn't bring our passport! (but who would when going to dinner!). So we got trapped at the Canadian immigration office for more than 2 hours! (actually I was surprised at how many people got trapped there! BTW, those Canadian officers don't seem nice at all - I didn't see anyone EVER smiled while waiting the two hours there!)  It was already past 10pm when I got back the hotel, being so frustrated, we wanted to watch some TV for relaxing, then the TV didn't work - called the front desk who sent some staff and fixed it. The 2nd day before checking out, I wrote to the hotel manager Debbie Peeling (got the card from the front desk) regarding my experience - it was a Sunday and she was not on duty so I would never expect any response the same day but surprisngly right after I checked into the Marriott in Toronto, I noticed her response email - appolizing for the inconvenience and offered some compensation. I was very impressed with the service and efficiency, especially during after hours. One thing I feel is that, no matter how good\u002Fsolid a hotel is, nobody can guarantee you never have any issue; the most important thing is, how the staff would resolve the issues when they arise.",5,positive

Upon looking at all the hotel options in Port Huron, this Fairfield seemed to make the most sense given its location, the rate, and the excellent reviews on TripAdvisor. I had booked the room about a week in advance and had no trouble at all.\n\nOur check-in process was quick and easy. We were able to check in a bit early which we greatly appreciated. The woman checking us in on Saturday afternoon was very friendly. Our room (#302) was clean and comfortable. We got a good night's sleep, and all was good.\n\nI appreciated the fact that there's a hot tub in the pool area. I always enjoy relaxing in the hot tub at a hotel when I can.\n\nBreakfast in the morning was excellent! The cheese omelettes were delicious, and I loved how they had cantaloupe, sausage patties, and vanilla (Greek) yogurt! I generally don't like the fruit yogurts, so anytime I find a hotel that has vanilla, I jump on it.\n\nThere were only two minor things I wasn't as crazy about... 1) the bathroom didn't automatically have lotion in it (I had to walk down to the front desk to pick up lotion) and 2) there was a staff member, maybe a manager, who seemed a bit concerned that I was taking photos around the hotel lobby and pool area. I had to explain to her that I take hotel photos for various reasons... including posting photos on TripAdvisor. It wasn't a huge deal but I don't think she liked the fact that I was taking photos.\n\nThose minor issues don't change the fact that this Fairfield was excellent.

Teams of Little League Baseball players running around like wild hyenas until midnight. No parent intervention to correct the behavior, no intervention by hotel staff to quiet the noise. Complete disregard for other hotel guests whom are attempting to get a peaceful nights rest at an inflated cost. I would guess that every guest is expected to respect the peace and tranquility of the facility within the fine print of the contract or face the risk of being dismissed from the property without refund. This standard is not being upheld either.\n\nPay the extra $20 a night and stay at a higher class hotel that does not have ultra thin walls and ceiling for all noises to be heard.

I'm sorry but in 2016 what cable company doesn't have ESPN? Get another provider. Also why put a radio in a room that doesn't work on FM.

The clerk who checked us in and out lives there I think-she was there late and very early.  There was a plumbing problem where the toilet overflowed and damaged our belongings and flooded the entire room.  The hotel is charging me for that and refusing to accept responsibility for their own plumbing issue.  \n\nWhen the overflow happened I called the front immediately and explained that we had done nothing and the overflow resulted from a simple effort to flush the toilet.  The clerk and two other women came up and apologized profusely and helped us move our belongings.   We were then put into another room that did not have heat.  The apparent jack of all trades clerk came into the new room and somehow got the heater to work after about 30 minutes.  This is all occurring after midnight when we were very tired and all we wanted to do was rest.  \n\nWhen I called to ask about the extra charge on my credit card, I spoke with the same clerk and notified the property that I was in contact with Baymont corporate who indicated that the property was wrong to charge me that fee.  She said, \""Okay, we look forward to that\"" and hung up.  Rude, inappropriate and ignorant.  Her remark was that she had never seen anything like that happen so it must be my fault.  \n\nI might also add that there were a total of three inaccurate charges on my card statement because apparently the clerk did not understand that when a customer pays cash, you do not charge their credit card also.  It took her two tries to correct the room charge--so I have five entries on my statement from this property: two room charges, two room reversal charges, and the \""cleaning fee\"" which is currently in dispute with my bank and with Baymont corporate.  \n\nAll in all a horrible experience and now much extra time spent on my end to resolve the clerical incompetence and apparent indifference to customer dissatisfaction.

I had 3 rooms under the block of my name, Jenny (last name omitted for security purposes), John and myself.   I spoke with Nikki about cancelling the other rooms, #4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and she told me I had to contact Expedia to cancel the rooms, but to call her back to make sure they cancelled the correct rooms.  I phoned Expedia and cancelled rooms #4, 5, 6, 7, 8.  I called Nikki back and she told me they had cancelled the correct rooms.   Nikki sent me confirmation as well, along with Expedia, to confirm everything was correct.  Jenny's room was for 8\u002F9 and 8\u002F10, John for 8\u002F10 and myself for 8\u002F10.  Both Jenny's room and John's rooms were available when they checked in.  As a matter of fact, I have a bank statement proving that John's room was paid for in the amount of $116.45 under my credit card number.  I arrived to work Monday morning to find two letters emailed from the Baymont stating I had an invalid card and my two rooms were cancelled.  I find that very odd that my card was invalid when in fact John's room was charged to my card and there was enough money to cover both rooms, plus.  Not to mention that if I did have an invalid card, which I did not, the hotel should have called me stating it was invalid, especially knowing this was for a wedding.  When I called in the morning on August 10th to see if I could arrive earlier than 3:00 the front desk should have said my card was invalid when she saw the reservations.  I also gave the front desk my confirmation numbers at that time.  Irregardless, because the card was charged for John's room proves it was a valid card.\n\nI am also upset that the bride's parents were not allowed to check in early because the hotel was sold out.  I wasn't asking for a ridiculously early time, but around 2:30, as the wedding was at 4:00.  I was told we could not check in early because the hotel was sold out.  I find it difficult to believe that the hotel could not have offered me the first room cleaned after the previous guests had checked out and the room was cleaned.  Check out is at noon, so obviously by 2:30 pm one room would have been cleaned by that time.\n\nLastly, I had another person who stayed at the Baymont who was there for the wedding and she was charged $160, even after stating she was reserving under the block for the wedding, and she did so weeks before I cancelled the other rooms on Wednesday, August 7th.\n\nThis experience during a wedding event was unacceptable.",1,negative

It is old and has not likely seen any updates over the past 25 years. This makes it dull and dreary. I have stayed in some newer baymont's that were rather nice and I guess this is what I was expecting. This property basically has the look and general feel of an older Super 8. The first room I was given smelled strongly of smoke. They gave me a second room that while not particularly fresh smelling was certainly an improvement over the first. I did appreciate the change although a non-smoking room should not smell like the first one. Bathrooms are tiny, beds really old, linens even older.\n\nThis place is serviceable for what it is but you need to expect what it is.

The hotel is located right on the St. Clair River (which makes up the border between Canada and the USA in Port Huron, MI), and overlooks the Blue Water Bridge that connects Canada with the USA.  \n\nThe DoubleTree is an excellent hotel.  We stayed on the 3rd Floor (there are a maximum of 3 floors on the property) in a King Suite.  The room had a balcony with a view of the St. Clair River and the Blue Water Bridge (the balcony had 2 chairs on it, and was very nice -- though we did not use it much due to the cold weather in Port Huron during our stay).  \n\nThe room was large, with a good LG big screen television, a very comfortable King-size bed, and a spacious bathroom.  The shower head is similar to hotels in Europe -- being that it is located very low in height, and being 6' myself I had to bend down to get under the head.  Despite this, the room is perfect.  \n\nThe restaurant -- Freighter's Eatery -- is located within the Hotel, and is very large and nice, with reasonable prices.  I had ordered a campside cheesecake slice (which is basically a smores cheesecake slice) for my wife while she was in the room, and Freighter's prepared it instantly (despite how busy they were and the lines of people at the time -- around 7:00PM), and delivered to our room.  I also want to thank Raven at the front desk who worked with Freighters to get the cheesecake up to the room promptly.  Thank you all so much!\n\nThe giftshop of the hotel is very nice as well, and fairly cheap.  The giftshop does close fairly early (it seems after 9:00PM), so make sure if you want to visit to do so as early as possible.  \n\nThe next time we visit Port Huron we would definitely stay at the DoubleTree again.

We planned to dine at Freighters in the evening, peruse the gift shop for some Christmas gift shopping and walk through the Christmas craft sale that was taking place at the onsite convention facility.  \n\nWe arrived at the hotel close to the 3:00 check-in time, unloaded our items onto a luggage cart and my parents sat down as I approached the front desk where Kayleh (sorry I know I am misspelling) greeted me and went through the check-in process explaining hotel policies, amenities, etc. as usual.  She handed me our delicious, warm cookies...everything was going great.  Then I asked about the hot tub and pool hours....that's when I felt the poke of a pin in my proverbial balloon.  Kayleh regretfully informed me that it was out of order, that it was like a shower in the pool room, and we would not be able to enjoy this amenity.  (My OCD planner\u002Forganizer does not adjust easily...it is a process for me.)  The disappointment (with my excited parents sitting down behind me) was more than I could handle, and I am sure Kayleh could read my change in emotion at the moment.  My mind was not quick to come up with an alternative.  We could not stay because I constantly reminded everyone, \""Bring your swimsuits!\""  (Myself and my CPA sister were both exhausted from work.).  \n\nThis is the moment when you find out how good of a hotel property you are dealing with.  As soon as I expressed my disappointment to Kayleh telling her how we had driven two hours expressly to stay at this hotel and to enjoy the pool and hot tub.  She began trying to make things right.  She offered to make arrangements for other area hotels that had similar amenities (although admitting none were as nice as the Doubletree).  I hesistated because, still wallowing in my disappointment, I could not think clearly.  She offered to comp our stay and breakfast vouchers...very generous.  After a few minutes, and as she assisted other guests facing the same dilemma, I allowed her to make other arrangements for us at the Fairfield Inn.  And...she insisted I take the cookies.  It had to be unpleasant for her to be in that situation, but she did her best to help us out.  For that I am still pleased with the professionalism and top-notch customer service there.  (When we got to the Fairfield, we found out they were holding a King room with a pull out sofa for us four adults and did not have any two bed options....see my review on Fairfield Inn Port Huron for more details.  This further added to our frustration but in the end it all worked out.)  \n\nThe point of this very long post is that you can plan everything out to perfection in your head, but things happen, things that are sometimes beyond a service providers control to address in your time frame.  How they handle the situation determines my desire to patronize them again.  No doubt, I will visit this hotel again if when my travels take me this way.  I still highly recommend the Doubletree Port Huron.",5,positive

We did not have a river view room but since our room was at the side of the hotel we just had to go out on our patio and sit alongside the patio area.  Good thing we bought camp chairs and brought them to the room as the ground floor rooms do not include patio chairs.  There are 2 reasons why I rated the hotel and 4 instead of a 5.  First, our room did not get cleaned the one night we stayed there.  This is not a cheap hotel and the real value you get is the quality of the room and service.  Clean room is a big part of the service.  I reported this to the front desk and someone was sent with clean towels.  I realize things like this happen sometimes, but it was disappointing.  The second reason is that there is no onsite complimentary breakfast which is pretty standard with hotel chains.  I stay in hotels a lot and Hilton is my preferred chain and I consider it above average most times.  To compare, I stayed at a  Best Western the next night and their rate was cheaper and their complimentary breakfast was comparable to the one I paid $11 per person at Freighters.

The last time we stayed at the property was the last week that the Thomas Edison Inn was opened.  I won\u2019t get into the sorry state the Thomas Edison Inn was in prior to closing, but let just say the Double Tree is totally remodeled and refurbished.  We booked the suite thanks to Hilton Honors having a \u201Csale\u201D.  You could tell the suite used to be two separate rooms with the wall between removed.  SO\u2026 very spacious indeed.  In the non-bedroom side of the suite was a full living room set up with a sofa (actually a hide-a-bed), two overstuffed chairs, coffee table, end tables and lamps, a huge desk, and a counter with a microwave, refrigerator, and full size sink.  You could have a party here!  So we did.  We invited friends for cocktails and appetizers before dinner (at Freighters found on the 1st floor of the hotel and reviewed separately).  The view from the room looked directly onto the river with the Blue Water Bridge to the left.  Really enjoyed the view.  The hotel staff was super friendly had helpful. And the room itself was immaculately clean.  So all in all, we\u2019ll definitely be back.  As a room tip, be sure to book a room with a water view and a suite if you so desire.",5,positive

I chose this location to be honest as it was only $97 a night (I chose a room with a view of the river so paid $116- still a steal).  I do business and normally stay in the Troy, Novi area but the hotels during that week were in the $250 a night range. So I took a chance, the hotel looked and sounded quaint although about an hour away from where I needed to be. I am so glad I took a leap! This DT was just a joy to be at, even for business. The room was really large, I kept the patio window opened at night as the nights were a bit cooler. For once, I had great and pretty uninterrupted internet service which is imp to me, since I hv work to do at the end of the day. Have been frustrated by ES lately as it seems whatever city i am in, when at an ES, the internet is so sporadic and dead I just want to pull my hair out! The room was very clean and comfortable. The view on the 2nd floor over looking the outdoor seating and river was so great. I kind of felt on vacation. Utilizing room service quite often, traveling as I do, the menu's some times at other Hiltons are not the great, or get boring. I have to say I loved and ordered every pm the Crabcakes! Phenomenal! Big chunks of delicious crab and not a ton of the breading to hold it together. You need to get these if you like crab.  And the salad, called a Twisted salad I was addicted. It had fresh asst of lettuce, dried cherries, nuts, bl cheese crumbles, raisins, other veg and a really great Cherry vinegarette that actually, yes tasted like cherries. I recommend ordering a half size with dinner. It was amazing. The dessert selection is a little lacking I thought and could use a change considering how creative the rest of the menu is.  I thought the prices too were acceptable.  The interactions with the front desk, room service at the door and on the phone, with the maid who cleaned my room even the ladies at the Gift shop (Great store by the way! Tons of cool stuff!) were all very good. I was treated kindly and felt welcomed and treated like a guest which of course we are!  The gym too ! Wow, it was one of the nicest and well equipped gyms I have ever been too in such a smaller hotel! Hey even if you don;t use it- check it out!  I will definitely go back even though it is not as close as I would like to be for work (btw, it is the last exit before you cross over into Canada).

As other reviews will tell you, it was declining fast near the end. I am a big lover of this location and Port Huron, so I was very pleased when this hotel was purchased and renovated. I called for assistance in determining why there were three price points of king water view rooms. The first time i called it rang and rang and disconnected. Called back, the person seemed in a big hurry, said its only different in terms of the size of the room, then put me on hold for 5 minutes....and I hung up. Very unhelpful.\n\nUpon arriving there was a VERY large rowdy group of middle aged women checking in. The woman at the desk, Ellen, was working as fast as possible to check them in. Apparently there was some confusion on dates, and the women were being quite difficult. She seemed to be handling the situation as fast as possible, but we stood there beside them a solid 10 minutes (no exaggeration) and the desk attendant didn't acknowledge us at all. She could have said, \""be right with you\"" at the very least. A younger girl, I did not get her name, came around  with two other guests from the hall (I'm not sure how they met up with her), she was friendly, acknowledged me, helped them, then me, and apologized for the wait. Great employee.\n\nThe room was very large. \""Premium water view king\"". The TV seemed small for the room, could not see from the bed. Couch and chair were hard to get comfortable for two people. I was very surprised in a luxury hotel that I paid $150 a night that wifi is not complimentary unless you are a HHonors gold or diamond member. The bed was comfortable, if not a little too soft. Also in a room this size I would expect a mini fridge for guests to use. I mean what do they cost, $40? I had a statement placed under the door the morning of checkout. It said I could leave my keys and press a button on the phone for express check out. Not finding this button I dialed zero and was told they don't have that button. That language should probably be changed on the statement to avoid confusion.\n\nOverall the hotel is much improved. Hallways and rooms gleam, love that the trees in the courtyard are gone, no impeded views. The elevators could use some new buttons, it makes it look worn out as they are still from TEI. The bathroom also lacked a vent fan. Pop machine didn't have a credit card reader, which was disappointing as I don't carry cash. The snack machines card reader wouldn't accept my MasterCard debit card. I did not check out the restaurant as the reviews here were mixed.\n\nThe hotel has some kinks to work out, but overall much improved. I will be back.

The concierge, Raven, was awesome and someone was out to clean it immediately. The gift shop had helpful woman and fun items. I liked it very much. My husband is handicapped and I checked before the booking to make sure that the facility was handicapped accessible but I found it lacking. They had built a ramp at the stairs and that was good, but when I viewed the on site restaurant it was not. Most of the chairs were the tall ones with high round tables. I went to the restaurant around 4pm to make a reservation so that when my husband made the long walk we could be seated quickly in one of the low tables but I was told they would not take a reservation. She said that they get busy later. I was not told that I could call from my room to get our name on a list. That is a reservation in my eyes. If I had been told that we could have called before to get our name on the list, we could have spent 20 minutes of that time on our walk there before My husband and I walked from our room to the restaurant, which took him 20 minutes only  to find a line of about 6 parties waiting to be seated in line in front of us. There was no where for him to sit so we began the walk back to the room. On our way we were stopped by staff who asked what happened and I told her, Within minutes the concierge was at our door offering to pay for our dinner if we ordered room service. We did not ask or complain. She offered. The next morning the dinner had been added to our bill. When I inquired as to why at the desk I was told that I would have to speak to the general manager of the restaurant. who gave us the third degree and did not want honor what we were told. I am not going to sit there and plead for a free meal. I left pissed off. We actually did not even eat our free breakfast to avoid the stupid restaurant. The bright spot at this hotel was Raven. She was beautiful helpful and tried very hard. I probably will never go back there. Other factors that were not in control of the hotel that were at the least distracting were a boys hockey team running loudly all over and a wedding with a ton of guests.",3,negative

Appetizer (salmon spread) and dinner (maple glazed salmon) was amazing, our servers were attentive and the next morning the breakfast buffet was outstanding. If I had any complaints about the restaurant the coffee cups are way too small and Bacon ran out as well as rolled up sets of silverware on the buffet line that we had to ask to be replenished . If I had any complaints at all it was lack of attention to cleaning up from a large wedding the night before in the courtyard area there were cardboard cases of beer and cans strewn in the sitting area at 9:30 in the morning when we looked outside to greet the day. There is an amazing place to walk up and down the river as well as a art show along the river front of outdoor art and a museum featuring Thomas Edison right by the restaurant.

I went out for dinner and to see the area so it was later that night when I got back to my room and laid down to go to sleep.\nAbout 10 seconds later, every spring and coil in that mattress was poking and stabbing me in every position I tried. I travel very regularly and I have stayed in almost every hotel there is from the east coast to the west coast and this was the first time I've endured a mattress that was worse than sleeping on the ground with rocks underneath you. The thickness of the mattress was as thick as the length of my iPhone 5. I called the front desk asking if the beds in the whole hotel were the same and the answer was yes it was. I told them it was way past time to upgrade the mattress's in the place. If your paying $130 per night you should have a nice, thick pillow top mattress as most hotels across the nation already have. Got maybe 3 hours of sleep and the worst back pain. \nI told my host that I could not stay there another night this weekend or next weekend when I come back and so they booked me into another hotel the following morning that had an amazing bed\u002Fmattress and I slept so good.

Also, the coffee cups were TINY... what if I wanted to take some to go?! Also, the front desk girls seemed to do nothing in between customers but stand outside and smoke cigarettes with the door open - meaning the smell came into the lobby area.

Since our initial reservation (April 2019), ratings\u002Fcomments have plummeted drastically. Due to guests making comments that they never received refunds\u002Fcompensation, we felt that we were in a catch-22 situation. Being a disabled retired veteran, finances are limited; therefore, losing five pre-paid nights is out of the question. Another complication is trying to find a hotel, during peak season travel, being difficult in the Port Huron area; this is why we booked early.\n\nAs for the room itself, it had many issues including ADA (American Disabilities Act) violations; cleanliness; bugs; mold; electrical issues; bathroom sink leaking on the floor; food left in refrigerator; carpet not vacuumed; unsecured handicap grab bar; hair dryer that fell on the floor; toilet paper holder ripped off the wall; musty and cigarette smell; mattresses (along with furniture) were stacked by the dumpster; large semi-size truck trailers in middle of parking area at back of hotel; dead tree branches left in front of  hotel rooms that were not being used\u002Foccupied; exterior stairway carpets in ill-repair; lack of exterior maintenance.\n\nOur first night, 7\u002F26, resulted in college students playing volleyball until 2 am. The second night, 7\u002F27, the amount of student guests increased drastically; they were congregating outside of our hotel room's door. Students were leaving beer cans literally on our window sill. We believe that they were smoking marijuana, as stated per other guest's comment. After calling the front desk on the second night, we felt threatened and like hostages after a student near our room pointed and stated \""that's him\"". Apparently the front desk clerk informed the students as to who had complained. \n\nOn July 27th, our daughter (who has a service animal was visiting us) contacted Wyndham Corporation to request a transfer to another Wyndham hotel. After being transferred to another department, she was hung up on. \n\nWhen we were eating breakfast, we heard management talking about closing down rooms. Another employee said \""what for, because of bedbugs?\"" One guest, during their stay, made a comment that they overheard an employee say \""lock the door\"".\n\nWe then sent an email to Wyndham Corporation on August 6th, along with NUMEROUS PICTURES. We received a phone call (8\u002F7) from them and a follow-up call (8\u002F13) a week later. During the first call, we were informed that they would be forwarding our email to property management, and information would be submitted to field operations for internal review. The final call, Wyndham offered as a remediation added points to our Wyndham Gold Membership. Their representative informed us that they were not able to take any action in relation to the Days Inn franchise. However, she stated that we could contact the Days Inn ourselves.\n\nWe received an email from property management on August 7th offering us a room of our choice for two nights. Per management, we were told that we were not assigned an ADA room; therefore, it did not need to be in compliance. However, our room was a handicap room, as the handicap sign was on our door's exterior (we have picture).  Management stated that they will be retraining their staff, and that they had an outsourced security company, which we never had seen during our stay. If they actually had any security at all, why was there so much turmoil going on.\n\nWe then proceeded to send a follow-up email on August 13th to management at the Days Inn. In this email, we stated that we had no intentions of staying at their hotel ever again. At the end of our stay, when checking-out, the manager offered a King Room, which she noted on the top of our receipt for a future stay. In reality, this establishment does not seem to realize that people do not want to come back under any circumstances. In our email, we basically stated that we wanted an acceptable rectification\u002Fcompensation to this situation.

The maintenance man.  Scott.  My dog does not go within 2 foot steps of my side, he was trained by the top academy in Lansing and also accredited through this academy.  He also does not bark.  The maintenance man was very upset upon us unpacking for the long weekend shaking his head and kept walking past our room, mind you the whole time my service dog didn't move an inch.  Each day I took him into the other parking lot and took him potty.  I was shouted at to make sure that I pick up after my dog, he did nothing, he just peed.  That's all.  I am a responsible owner and I clean up after my dog.  One of the other nights I was standing outside talking with my children that were staying in another room, and he walked past and again, my service dog didn't move or make a noise, he didn't have a leash on, but I was standing right there and I put my hand down on his collar, and he shouted at me to leash my dog.  Ok, cause he is just standing here.  I do believe that my room was entered into when we were not there, we put our sign on our door when we left and left our dog in the room, when returning to the room, the sign was inside the room.  How did that happen.  Who was in our room and why and what did they do to him??? All of housekeeping knew that we needed nothing.  Scott the maintenance man with the red van would be the only one.  Also on the last night of staying there, I was alerted by my children that there was someone smoking pot in the same area of this mans residence as he does stay on property.  This man needs to be terminated.  He is creepy, sketchy, and rude to clients.  Now to service animals, what kind of human being is this.  \n\nMy dog is trained better than 99 percent of animals that I have ever met because when he was rescued I took the time and the money to take him to the academies to get his metals of valor that he earned and wears proudly.    He didn't deserve to be treated like this and neither did the parents that paid for him to be there.\n\nI am highly disappointed.

As seasoned parents visiting a hotel for a hockey tournament we know all of the rules, our boys are at the age that we were confident that they wouldn't be a problem and during our stay there we no complaints on the boys behaviour within the hotel.  We were all provided a pamphlet upon arrival in which we had to sign a variety of paperwork, like no mini stick no drinking in the hallway, no more than x # of people in the room ect.  We all signed the required paperwork as requested.  \n\nDuring the first 24 hours of our stay however the sheriff was called 2 separate times on two of the mom's traveling with their sons.....it was a total disgrace and as a long time MARRIOTT elite member it was like NOTHING i have even seen at a hotel.  What i didn't know is that this Hampton Inn in Port Huron is a franchised location and the person that runs this hotel calls the shots and make decisions about how the overall brand is represented and guests complaints are handled.\n\nI am sure they will be both providing their colourful versions of their experience for your reading pleasure but thought it was important share the anxiety it brought the rest of the kids on the team knowing or seeing what happened here.\n\nOne family upon check in in which they had 30 mins to check in get to the room change and head to the rink the mom asked to confirm the nightly price of the hotel of which we booked 7 months prior to arrival so the question was not our of line.  She was rudely answer by clerk who was working behind the counter, as she was checking in there was another mom from a different team checking in at the same time, after all paperwork as discussed above was signed she went up to her room only to find someone was already in room 208, this person wasn't in the room however their personal belongings like purse and wallet we in plain sight on the bed.  She immediately went downstairs now only with limited time to get ready and go for the game her son had to change in the public bathroom into his suit at the hotel and the room situation couldn't be resolved in this short person, after the game and upon the arrival back which was now about 10pm the room was clear the other guest was so upset with the violation they left and were also treated terribly by the staff.  Our parent was treated terribly she said how she wasn't sure how safe she felt after this incident there was NO apology from the staff just that it was a mistake and then the staff clerk went on to call this mom a drama queen. Then the sheriff was called the manager was on the phone recounting to her what happened ect however once he heard his side of the story he did apologized he asked the sheriff to leave and she was given her room keys back.  The manager promised to show up the next day with gift cards to show how sorry he was...... which never did happen.  There is definitely more detail to the story but that is high level.\n\nThe second call to the sheriff was around payment what is important to note here is that our cards were charged before we even arrived for our stay which the contract we signed was for 3 nights, this parents card was declined when they did the transaction as it was a debit visa, the manager had called her before she arrived to let her know she needed another form of payment so provided that but requested that the card not be charged as she wanted to pay cash for the room upon her arrival.  When she arrived she provided cash payment and the credit card was there for any incidentals however after confirming with her credit card company 3 additional nights had been charged to her card so she is has now paid twice for 3 nights and her head had not even hit the pillow.  This guest was also speaking with the same clerk behind the counter she called her manager again as well as the sheriff to remove the guest for question what she was being billed for!  REALLY???  She was removed from the hotel by the sheriff, One of these guests is a teacher and the other is a daycare provider for children if that speaks to their character at all.  Both of these women were calm reasonable and did not use fowl language.  As I said this is a very high level reenactment however this drama caused entire team stress knowing our parents were dealing with this we had no control over what was happening despite the fact that a few dads and the coach stepped in to help calm the situation as it seemed the manager felt that dealing with women was below his pay grade..... and I will leave it at that!   oh one more thing both of these woman were charged for their full stay even though one of them only stayed one night and was removed the second day!",1,negative

Make your own waffles, toast, bagels etc.  Yoghurt, cereals, eggs, cheese omlette's, sausage, fresh juices, and more. Savings right there .. if you were to go out to eat.  \n  Karen * I hope I got her name correct.  On check out Oct 10th ( Thursday) was very friendly and helpful when I asked about stores and directions etc.  The girl on breakfast buffet, making sure everything was stocked and clean was also very friendly, she did a great job.\n  We would stay there again for sure.

We were excited to stay in the fairly new hotel and was greeted by an exuberant assistant general manager. The cost for one night was $102.00 and we were happy about the assigned room we had facing the river. After unpacking and putting on swimsuits, me and my 8 year old son headed down to the pool.  When we got to the pool there was a sign on the door stating the pool was closed due to a mechanical issue. Needless to say, my young son was disappointed.  When I asked the assistant manager about the pool he stated, \""It will probably be open later today or tomorrow.\"" When I pressed him on the issue he stated it probably wouldn't be ready for a few days. I was not happy that he blatantly lied the first time I asked about it. He also said it was just brought to his attention that day even though he said the (needed) part for the pool had been ordered a week prior. I told him it was important for him to let families know ahead of time about the pool so they weren't surprised like we were and disappointed. He kept skirting the issue and when I asked that he terminate our reservation so we could find a local hotel with a functioning pool, he became rude and condescending. When I asked to speak to the manager, he stated that he was the assistant manager. When I asked to speak with the hotel manager, he said she was in an evaluation meeting and would not be able to speak to me for some time. I told him I would wait to speak to her. He then told me we needed to move away from the counter so he could attend to other customers even though none were in sight. He asked me and my son to move out of the way and kept \""fleeing\"" to the back room where I could see him talking on his phone. I believe this young assistant manager needs to be trained in how to handle conflict and how to speak graciously to disappointed customers instead of becoming belligerent and defensive. We waited as long as we could to speak to the manager, but couldn't wait any longer. This staff person said he would have to wait for the manager to refund our reservation, but then said he was able to take care of it, but never provided me with a cancellation number or document. \nI will NOT make another reservation for me or any other family members at this hotel.  By the way, we had come into town to surprise by dad for Father's Day. He has terminal cancer and so that trip there was difficult and I had hoped to stay somewhere comfortable, customer-friendly, and safe.

We had no choice as to whether or not we wanted a safe in our room but when the bill came on the day of check-out there was a charge for it.  Likewise, the refrigerator.  There was none in the room but we could have asked for a room with one and paid more.  I know pretty surely that all or most of the rooms at this hotel had refrigerators in the past.  Also, when we reserved the rooms we asked for 2 adjoining.  When we checked in the desk clerk told us they don't have adjoining rooms but we were next door to each other which was OK.  However, when we got to our rooms, lo and behold they were adjoining.  Also, we didn't spend much time in the room but the one time I turned on the TV it was not great and had very minimal cable service.  One more thing was the lighting in the room wasn't great - it somehow seemed like there should have been one more light.  The other problem we had was the Wi-Fi only worked in the lobby - not in the rooms.  They said they had been having trouble with it for a few days.  This was Black Friday weekend when I'm sure they were at capacity.  One might think it prudent when you have a full house to make sure this was fixed before everyone got there.\n\nI realize these are very small, petty things and I'm not even really complaining - only saying this to let others know what they can expect if they book this hotel.  I also think it is silly that the hotel would cut back on these small items.  The room was just fine - lovely bed linens, everything including the bathroom was nice and clean.

When I inquired about the noise to a man in the hall around 12:00 midnight he told me it was a boys hockey team and they were just having fun. I told him that 12 year old boys should be in their rooms at midnight and asleep. Then I realized the parents were all drinking in a couple of rooms and did not even know where their kids were. Needless to say we did not get a good nights sleep and upon talking to other people the next day in the breakfast room they were pretty upset also.

Not only were they running up and down the halls, the people in the room above us were literally bouncing off the walls.  We were tolerant until 3am when I called the front desk and asked them to do something about it.  The gentleman informed me that he had received numerous complaints, and so far he couldn't do anything about it, but he would try again.  The noise continued until past 5am.  Without being crude, what we were hearing were 4 people in one room having sex for hours.  This was confirmed the next morning by the agent at the checkout desk, who read us the log book.  It stated that two of the players brought home some girls from the bar.\n\nComfort Inn has a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee that states \""If you are not 100% satisfied for any reason, you don't pay for your room.\""  When we checked out, we fully expected them to honor this agreement.  We were told by the agent at the desk that she didn't have the authority to do this, however she called the manager on call and got approval to charge my card half price for the rooms.  (The third charge was removed because my partner paid for his room on his card, which he is also disputing) She stated that I would have to call the manager the following day and the matter would be investigated and the charges would be removed.\n\nAfter waiting two days to hear from the management I was told that YES, I should not have to pay for my room, but because the rooms were all in my name, they would only honor their guarantee for ONE room.

The hotel charged a very high nightly rate with a 3 night stay required.  I would have been ok with this as it is a very busy weekend and there are not enough hotel rooms for all the hockey teams travelling from across North America to be there.  The rates were high but not ludicrous and it was better than staying in Flint.\n\nExcept that the service was very poor.  Two of the three nights we were there, the housekeeping service didn't clean up the room.  The standard line was that there was someone in the room when they came by which was true once but not both times (ie. maybe this was a convenient excuse for an over-worked housekeeping staff).  In any event, they should still make note of which rooms they missed and come back and make up the rooms.  Most hotels seem capable of coming by more than once to clean-up the rooms.\n\nThe second time it happened (when we knew we weren't in the room as we were at the rink all day) we phoned the front desk and were told that housekeeping had already gone home for the day.  The front desk people suggested that there was no one who could even bring fresh linens or towels to the rooms as they were too busy at the front desk to come by.  Not sure what they were doing there, apart from listening to complaints, as the hotel was full and so no one was checking in or out.  No offers of credit off the room (didn't need to since we all paid in advance) or even a credit off a future stay.\n\nVery disappointing from a national hotel chain that should know better.\n\nPerhaps next time, when you have occupancy at 3 or 4 times your normal rate, add additional staff on to service them.
